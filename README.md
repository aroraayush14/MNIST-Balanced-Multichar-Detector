# MNIST-Balanced-Multichar-Detector 
This consists of Ipython notebook for a CNN model that detects mutiple characters in an image file drawn in a Tkinter Canvas
and detects the characters in left to right order.
The model has been trained on EMNIST BALANCED dataset extracted from binary files and converted to csv format.

# MNIST Balanced Multichar Detector

This project implements a balanced multicharacter detector using the MNIST dataset in Python. The goal is to create a model capable of detecting multiple characters present in an image using the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digits.

## Overview

The project utilizes the MNIST dataset, a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. However, the objective here is to extend the model's capability to detect and classify multiple characters present in an image rather than single digits.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (NumPy, TensorFlow, etc.): See `requirements.txt` for details.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mnist-balanced-multichar-detector.git
